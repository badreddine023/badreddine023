# 🌐 Baha Badreddine: Blockchain & Decentralized Systems Engineer

### "The Universe is Written in the Language of Mathematics."

A highly innovative **Engineering Developer** specializing in the convergence of **Blockchain Technology, Artificial Intelligence, and Decentralized Internet Architectures**. My work focuses on creating mathematically coherent, resilient, and self-sovereign systems that push the boundaries of distributed computing.

## 💼 Foundational Experience

My journey into decentralized technology is rooted in a foundational 7.5 years of experience as a **Miner** (pre-2021). This role provided deep, practical insight into the physical infrastructure, operational resilience, and energy dynamics of distributed systems, which now informs my work as an Engineering Developer.
