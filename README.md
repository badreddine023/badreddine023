# 🌐 Baha Badreddine: Blockchain & Decentralized Systems Engineer

### "The Universe is Written in the Language of Mathematics."

--- 

A highly innovative **Engineering Developer** with **6+ years of experience** in software development, specializing in the convergence of **Blockchain Technology, Artificial Intelligence, and Decentralized Internet Architectures**. My work focuses on creating mathematically coherent, resilient, and self-sovereign systems that push the boundaries of distributed computing.

## 💼 Professional Journey & Expertise

My career is built on a unique blend of hands-on operational experience and advanced software engineering. I bring a holistic perspective to decentralized systems, understanding both their theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation challenges.

### Software Engineering & Development (6+ Years)

With over six years dedicated to software development, I have honed my skills in crafting robust, scalable, and secure applications. My expertise spans across various programming paradigms and technologies, with a strong focus on Python, TypeScript, and Rust for blockchain and AI-driven solutions.

### Foundational Mining Experience (7.5 Years, pre-2021)

My journey into decentralized technology is rooted in a foundational 7.5 years of experience as a **Miner** (pre-2021). This role provided deep, practical insight into the physical infrastructure, operational resilience, and energy dynamics of distributed systems, which now profoundly informs my work as an Engineering Developer. This hands-on understanding of distributed networks from the ground up is a unique asset in architecting resilient blockchain solutions.
